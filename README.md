# DevOps-Technical-Deployment-Demo-on-ECSFargate.<br>
For the scope of this lab I use the ECS Fargate is growing faster than Kubernetes (K8S) service.<br>
ECS Fargate allows to run containers without managing servers or clusters. This easy-to-use, low maintenance option can be interesting, especially to SMB companies concerned about K8S's complexity.<br>
How it works from [AWS Fargatet]([https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)) for more information.
